Experimenting with different HTML and CSS properties to create my own webpage resume. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
Playing around with...

...in HTML
1) how to organize my webpage with  div's and classes in HTML
2) lists
3) linking to CSS stylesheet
4) referencing Google fonts

...in CSS
1) fonts
2) colours
3) positioning
4) content
5) background images
6) boxes
7) borders

NOTES:
a) Best viewed on a desktop versus tablet or phone. Haven't gotten around to experimenting much with responsive web design yet. 
b) I felt I could've organized grouped my selectors much better on my CSS. I tried to simplify certain elements on HTML to remove some selectors on CSS, but that changed the layout a bit. 
c) Please refer to files "melinda-resume3.html" and "melinda-resume3.css" for final versions.

Enjoy!
